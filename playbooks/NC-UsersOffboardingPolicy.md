# Offboarding Process
## Phase 1: Manage the resignation process
When an employee tenders their resignation, it’s time for HR to jump in and begin the offboarding process.

- Document the contract termination: Have the employee sign a formal letter of resignation for your records.
- Schedule an exit interview: Plan a time to meet with the employee before they leave to get feedback on their experience with the company, their role, and reasons for leaving. The exit interview is one of the last interactions the employee will have with your organization, so it’s important to make it a priority and come prepared.  
- Notify their team: Don’t let gossip get ahead of you. Let the team know of the employee’s upcoming departure and monitor the team’s reaction and needs. Keep lines of communication open to ensure the team is supported and confident moving forward.
- Communicate with clients: If the employee was client-facing, create a plan of action for notifying their clients and managing the client handoffs (e.g., identify who will be taking over the accounts and make sure they have the information and resources needed for a smooth transition).

## Phase 2: Prepare the paperwork
- Review contracts and NDAs: Conduct a final review of the employee’s contract to make sure all items are in order. You may want to review any non-disclosure agreements with the employee before they leave to clarify any lingering questions.
- Prepare compensation, benefits, and tax documents: Once you know an employee is leaving, work with accounting to review the employee compensation package and tax information to ensure everything is in order. This process might include:
- - Processing outstanding employee reimbursements
- - Confirming that employee doesn’t owe reimbursement for bonuses or paid time off
- - Preparing tax and benefits documentation for the employee to take before they leave

## Phase 3: Plan the work handoff process
To ensure a smooth transition and no interruption in production or services, you’ll need to plan a handoff process. Work with the employee and/or their manager to identify what needs to be done.

- Determine who will be the replacement: Who will take over the old employee’s role? Will the work be redistributed across multiple people?
- Identify training needs: Once you know who will be taking over, identify what training they will need. Will the employee train their replacement? Are there any skills gaps that need to be addressed?
- Prepare information/files/documentation for handoff: Have the employee gather any information or files their replacement will need access to, including passwords, account lists, client info, procedural notes, etc.
- Create a to-do list for final projects and deliverables: Work with the employee to determine how they will tie up their ongoing projects. What deliverables or milestones are they responsible for before they leave? Make sure you (or their manager) follows up so there aren’t any loose ends.
